### Sentiment analysis is that the process of detecting positive, negative or neutral sentiment in reviews. Itâ€™s often employed by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers




## Steps followed:
- Clean the raw data by removing white spaces and unwanted characters.
- Remove stopwords to reduce the size of the data set and improve NLP tasks.
- Use the Vader Sentiment Analyzer to assign sentiment scores to reviews.
- Consider the compound score for further modeling as it represents the overall sentiment of the review.
- Use the TF-IDF Vectorizer to give more weightage to important words for better modeling.
- Convert text into numerical values using the vectorizer for input to machine learning models.
- Use Logistic Regression as a statistical method for classification problems, such as predicting binary or multiclass outcomes.
- Use Naive Bayes as a probabilistic algorithm for text classification based on Bayes' theorem.
- Use FastText as an open-source library for text classification and representation learning based on the Skip-gram model.
- Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test set.
- Compare the performance of the models to select the best one for the task.
- Train the selected model on the entire dataset.
- Train the selected model on the entire dataset.
- Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new reviews.
- Evaluate the performance of the model on the new reviews.
- Refine the model based on the performance evaluation and repeat the training and testing steps as necessary.
